# Robotics

This repository contains some of my (past, and hopefully future) robotics ventures that were unfortunately not under any version control. 

Warning: This is a personal archive. I'm still in the process of organizing everything, so it is likely incomplete and may be split up in the future. Some of the past codes are also quite messy, hence it probably isn't a good idea to attempt to use them directly. (I've only stripped away obviously irrelevant files.) However, if you find any of the code interesting, feel free to use them if you'd like to.

Currently included:
* [NUSH Robotics Club](https://github.com/NUSH-Robotics)
    * Stuff building on [c4ev3](https://github.com/c4ev3) ([Gitlab Link for relevant work by my friend for MacOS](https://gitlab.com/wernjie/c4ev3))
        * A guide I wrote back in 2019 for setting it up to work with C++11
        * Some examples and tests I tried with my C++ compiler
        * Code (and other files) for my National Robotics Competition attempt
